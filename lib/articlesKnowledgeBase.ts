## 🗓️ Publishing Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–4)**  
> Framer Motion basics, React Hook Form, Glassmorphism, App Router Intro

**Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5–10)**  
> Scroll animations, cursor follower, animated forms, Sheets integration

**Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Weeks 11–16)**  
> 3D card effects, neural network visualization, performance optimization, complete walkthrough

## 🧭 Writing Guidelines

Each article includes:
- Problem → Solution → Why it Matters
- Real code snippets from the portfolio
- Visuals (GIFs / screenshots)
- Best practices & performance notes
- Read time: 5–10 minutes

**Tone:** Conversational + Technical clarity  
**Audience:** Intermediate frontend devs and aspiring web animators  
**Goal:** Teach, inspire, and show technical depth while humanizing the process.

## 📈 Long-Term Vision

The portfolio doubles as a **learning documentation system** — every major feature, animation, or design choice is an article opportunity.  
Eventually, the AI assistant in the portfolio will be able to:
- Summarize any article in natural language  
- Suggest related topics to readers  
- Guide visitors through learning paths (Beginner → Advanced)
