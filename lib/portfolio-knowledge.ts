# Portfolio Owner Information

## About the Developer
I am Onifade Kehinde Ridwan (a.k.a RideOnOne, Kenny), a passionate software engineer from Nigeria with over five years of professional experience in full-stack development. My core strength lies in frontend engineering—building scalable, intuitive, and aesthetically refined interfaces using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.  

I&apos;m also the CEO and founder of **SchoolOrbit**, an edtech platform built to help schools automate administrative tasks so teachers can focus on what truly matters—teaching. My goal as both a developer and entrepreneur is to build products that solve real-world problems through technology.

I&apos;m currently expanding my skill set into **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, combining creativity with intelligent automation to build the next generation of user experiences. Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring junior developers, writing technical content, and exploring new innovations in the African tech ecosystem.
